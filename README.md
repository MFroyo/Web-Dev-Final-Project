# Website-Project

Final Project for CSCI 331- Web Development. The following project is also a project for a GTA community, Code4PD, that requested a webpage for their community.
I used a generic template created by a Melm and heavily modified for the needs of the community to include SQL, images, and funtionality for the menu system. I learned most of the 
SQL from Carson Gross while taking CSCI 440 - Databases.
